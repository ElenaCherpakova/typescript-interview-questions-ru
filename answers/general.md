## <a name="main-features"></a>Каковы основные особенности TypeScript?

- Cross-Platform: The TypeScript compiler can be installed on any operating system such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- ES6 Features: TypeScript includes most features of planned ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) such as Arrow functions.
- Object-Oriented Language: TypeScript provides all the standard OOP features like classes, interfaces, and modules.
- Static Type-Checking: TypeScript uses static typing and helps type checking at compile time. Thus, you can find compile-time errors while writing the code without running the script.
- Optional Static Typing: TypeScript also allows optional static typing in case you are used to the dynamic typing of JavaScript.
- DOM Manipulation: You can use TypeScript to manipulate the DOM for adding or removing client-side web page elements.
